# On the Server Side:
# The server is typically responsible for interfacing with the client, performing application-specific logic, and publishing events to Kafka when specific actions occur. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of tasks on the server:

# Post Creation:

# Validate incoming post data (e.g., text, images, tags).
# Create the post entry in the database (e.g., MySQL).
# Publish an event to the Kafka topic post-creation-events with all post-related data (post content, user ID, timestamp, etc.).
# Post Update:

# Validate and process the updated data (e.g., changed caption, tags).
# Update the post record in the database.
# Publish an event to the Kafka topic post-update-events containing the updated data (post ID, new content, etc.).
# Post Engagement (Likes and Comments):

# When a user likes a post or adds a comment, update the post's metadata in the database (e.g., increment the like count or add a comment to the list).
# Publish a message to the relevant Kafka topic (post-like-events or post-comment-events) with necessary data (e.g., post ID, user ID, comment text, timestamp).
# Post Deletion:

# Delete the post entry from the database.
# Publish an event to the Kafka topic post-deletion-events to notify other parts of the system about the deletion.
# Media Processing:


# Handle any media processing tasks (e.g., generating thumbnails for images, processing video files).
# Publish events to the post-media-processing-events topic when processing is complete or when further actions are needed
