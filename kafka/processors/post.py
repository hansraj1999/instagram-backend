# Post Event Handling:
# Consumers of the post-creation-events topic may perform additional tasks like:
# Processing the media (e.g., generating thumbnails, optimizing images).
# Publishing the data to Elasticsearch for full-text search indexing.
# Updating user activity feeds.
# Consumers of the post-update-events topic may:
# Update the relevant post data in secondary data stores (e.g., Elasticsearch for fast querying).
# Reindex posts in search engines if the caption or other searchable fields change.
# Post Engagement Events:

# Consumers of the post-like-events or post-comment-events topics could:
# Update real-time counters (like post "like count" and "comment count") in a cache (e.g., Redis) for faster access.
# Update analytics platforms or data warehouses to track user engagement metrics.
# Send notifications to users when their posts are liked or commented on.
# Media Processing:

# Consumers of the post-media-processing-events topic may:
# Perform background media processing (e.g., resizing images, transcoding videos).
# Generate metadata for media and update the corresponding PostMetaData in the database.
# Notify users once media processing is completed.
# Post Deletion:

# Consumers of the post-deletion-events topic could:
# Remove associated media from the storage (e.g., S3).
# Remove any associated entries from caches (e.g., Redis).
# Update search indexes (Elasticsearch) to delete the post data.
